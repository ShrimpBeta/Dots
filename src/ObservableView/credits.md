# Credits
The source files in Dots/ObservableView were directly copied from the repository (https://github.com/thomasgalliker/ObservableView) due to a compilation error (`MSBUILD: Avalonia error AVLN:9999: Member 'System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection`1' is declared in another module and needs to be imported`):
- Original Author: **Thomas Galliker** (https://github.com/thomasgalliker)
- Repository: https://github.com/thomasgalliker/ObservableView
- Package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ObservableView/

The copying was necessary to address the compilation issue and ensure the proper functioning of the project. I would like to sincere thank the original author for the great work and effort put into the project 🙌 A Pull Request will be created to address the issue in the original repository.
